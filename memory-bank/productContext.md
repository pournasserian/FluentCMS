# FluentCMS Product Context

## Why FluentCMS Exists

FluentCMS exists to solve several common challenges in the CMS space, particularly within the .NET ecosystem:

1. **Headless Architecture Need**: Traditional CMSs often tightly couple content management with presentation, limiting flexibility. FluentCMS separates these concerns by providing a pure API-based backend.

2. **Database Flexibility**: Many CMS solutions are tied to a specific database technology. FluentCMS breaks this limitation by supporting multiple database providers through a unified abstraction layer.

3. **.NET Core Modernization**: The project brings modern ASP.NET Core practices to the CMS space, leveraging the performance and cross-platform capabilities of .NET Core.

4. **Blazor Integration**: As Blazor technology matures, there's a need for CMS solutions that integrate well with this modern UI framework.

## Problems Solved

### For Developers

1. **Technology Lock-in Avoidance**: Developers can choose their preferred database technology while maintaining a consistent API.

2. **Reduced Learning Curve**: Follows familiar .NET patterns and conventions, making it approachable for .NET developers.

3. **Customization Flexibility**: The modular architecture allows for extending or replacing components without affecting the entire system.

4. **Modern Development Experience**: Built on ASP.NET Core, enabling developers to use the latest .NET features and tools.

### For Organizations

1. **Reduced Migration Costs**: The ability to switch database providers without changing application code reduces future migration costs.

2. **Scalability Options**: Organizations can choose the database technology that best fits their scale and performance requirements.

3. **Integration Capabilities**: Headless architecture makes it easier to integrate with various frontend technologies and existing systems.

4. **Future-Proofing**: The modular design allows for adopting new technologies without complete rewrites.

## How FluentCMS Should Work

### Content Management

1. **Content Modeling**: Administrators define content types with specific fields and validation rules.

2. **Content Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete content items through a consistent API.

3. **Content Relations**: Establish relationships between different content types.

4. **Content Querying**: Filter, sort, and search content based on various criteria.

### System Configuration

1. **Database Selection**: Configure the preferred database provider at startup.

2. **Repository Configuration**: Set database-specific options like connection strings and collection/table preferences.

3. **API Configuration**: Configure API-specific settings like authentication, authorization, and routing.

### Integration Path

1. **API Consumption**: Frontend applications consume the CMS API to retrieve and manage content.

2. **Authentication Flow**: Secure API access through standard authentication mechanisms.

3. **Media Handling**: Upload, retrieve, and manipulate media assets through dedicated endpoints.

## User Experience Goals

### For API Consumers

1. **Consistent Interface**: Provide a consistent API regardless of the underlying database provider.

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Offer clear documentation with examples for all API operations.

3. **Predictable Behavior**: Ensure consistent error handling and response formats.

4. **Performance**: Optimize data access and API responses for speed and efficiency.

### For Content Editors (via future Blazor Frontend)

1. **Intuitive Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface for content management operations.

2. **Real-time Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback on actions and validation.

3. **Efficient Workflows**: Streamline common content management tasks.

4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the interface works well on various devices and screen sizes.

## Differentiation from Alternatives

1. **Database Flexibility**: Unlike many CMS solutions, FluentCMS is not tied to a specific database technology.

2. **.NET Core Native**: Built from the ground up for ASP.NET Core, rather than being ported from earlier frameworks.

3. **Blazor Focus**: Specifically designed to work well with Blazor frontend technology.

4. **Developer-Centric**: Prioritizes a good developer experience with clean architecture and familiar patterns.
