# FluentCMS Project Progress

## What Works

### Core Entity Infrastructure
- ✅ Base entity interfaces and classes (`IBaseEntity`, `BaseEntity`)
- ✅ Auditable entity interfaces and classes (`IAuditableEntity`, `AuditableEntity`)
- ✅ Entity ID generation and tracking

### Repository Pattern
- ✅ Repository abstraction layer (`IBaseEntityRepository<TEntity>`)
- ✅ Generic CRUD operations defined
- ✅ Type constraints for repository entities

### Database Provider Implementations
- ✅ MongoDB repository implementation with full CRUD support
- ✅ LiteDB repository implementation with full CRUD support
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Configuration options for database providers
- ✅ Dependency injection registration

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Project structure and organization
- ✅ NuGet package dependencies

## What's Left to Build

### Database Providers
- ❌ Entity Framework Core repository implementation
- ❌ SQLite repository implementation
- ❌ SQL Server repository implementation

### Core Features
- ❌ Content type system
- ❌ Content validation
- ❌ Content relations
- ❌ Advanced querying capabilities
- ❌ Media management

### Infrastructure
- ❌ Service layer
- ❌ API controllers
- ❌ Authentication and authorization
- ❌ Error handling middleware
- ❌ API documentation
- ❌ Unit and integration tests

### Frontend Integration
- ❌ Blazor server frontend
- ❌ Admin UI for content management
- ❌ User management interface

## Current Status

### Development Phase
- **Early Development**: Focused on core architectural components
- **Active Areas**: Repository pattern implementation and database provider support
- **Next Focus**: Entity Framework, SQLite, and SQL Server repositories

### Component Status

| Component | Status | Priority | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Entity Models | 90% | High | Base models complete, content-specific models pending |
| Repository Abstraction | 80% | High | CRUD operations complete, advanced querying pending |
| MongoDB Provider | 90% | High | Core functionality complete, may need additional features |
| LiteDB Provider | 90% | High | Core functionality complete, may need additional features |
| EF Core Provider | 10% | Medium | Project setup only |
| SQLite Provider | 10% | Medium | Project setup only |
| SQL Server Provider | 10% | Medium | Project setup only |
| Service Layer | 0% | High | Not started |
| API Layer | 0% | High | Not started |
| Authentication | 0% | Medium | Not started |
| Content Type System | 0% | High | Not started |
| Blazor Frontend | 0% | Low | Planned for future phase |

## Known Issues and Challenges

### Technical Debt
- ⚠️ Repository interface may need extension for advanced querying
- ⚠️ Transaction support varies across database providers
- ⚠️ Need consistent error handling strategy across providers

### Feature Gaps
- ⚠️ No content-specific entity models defined yet
- ⚠️ No pagination support in repository layer
- ⚠️ No filtering/sorting mechanisms defined

### Performance Considerations
- ⚠️ Need to evaluate repository implementation performance across providers
- ⚠️ Connection pooling strategy not defined for all providers
- ⚠️ Large dataset handling approach not established

## Roadmap

### Short-term (1-2 Months)
1. Complete remaining database provider implementations
2. Design and implement content type system
3. Create service layer with business logic
4. Set up initial API endpoints

### Medium-term (3-6 Months)
1. Implement authentication and authorization
2. Develop media management capabilities
3. Add advanced querying and filtering
4. Set up comprehensive API documentation

### Long-term (6+ Months)
1. Build Blazor server frontend
2. Implement admin UI for content management
3. Create user management system
4. Develop templates and themes system
