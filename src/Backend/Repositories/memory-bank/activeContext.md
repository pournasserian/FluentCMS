## Key Challenges

### 1. EntityFrameworkEntityRepository Implementation

**Challenge:**
How to properly implement the abstract repository pattern while still leveraging EF Core's capabilities effectively.

**Options Being Considered:**
- Minimal abstraction that exposes IQueryable for advanced queries
- Full abstraction with specialized methods for common query patterns
- Hybrid approach with extension methods for advanced scenarios

**Current Direction:**
Implementing a hybrid approach that provides basic repository operations through the interface while allowing for extension methods to handle advanced EF Core-specific scenarios.

### 2. Cross-Provider Consistency

**Challenge:**
Ensuring consistent behavior across document-based (MongoDB, LiteDB) and relational (EF Core, MySQL) providers.

**Options Being Considered:**
- Strict behavior parity at the expense of performance
- Provider-optimized implementations with some behavior differences
- Core consistency with provider-specific extensions

**Current Direction:**
Focusing on core operation consistency while allowing optimized implementations for each provider, with clear documentation about any provider-specific behaviors.

### 3. Transaction Support

**Challenge:**
How to handle transactions consistently across providers with different transaction capabilities.

**Options Being Considered:**
- Lowest common denominator approach (basic atomic operations only)
- Provider-specific transaction APIs
- Abstract Unit of Work pattern with provider-specific implementations

**Current Direction:**
Implementing a Unit of Work pattern that adapts to each provider's capabilities, with fallback patterns for providers with limited transaction support.

## Relation to Backend Active Context

This Repositories sub-project work directly implements the "Complete Additional Repository Implementations" focus area mentioned in [the Backend activeContext.md](../../memory-bank/activeContext.md), providing more granular details about the specific repository implementations.
